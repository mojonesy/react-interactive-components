  /* What do we pass to useState as an argument? 
     The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state.
     We can keep a number or a string if thatâ€™s all we need. 
     In our example, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, 
     so pass 0 as initial state for our variable. 
     (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice.)
     useState() returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. */
